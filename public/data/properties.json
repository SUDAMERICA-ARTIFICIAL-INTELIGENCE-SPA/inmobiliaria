    "description": "Suite 4004 is a deliberate choice for those who want to live above the energy of the city, without losing connection to it. Perched high above Miami's skyline, this fully furnished one-bedroom plus den, two-bath residence offers unobstructed 180-degree south city & water views that shape the rhythm of each day. Mornings begin with espresso as the sun rises over the bay. Evenings wind down as the skyline lights shimmer below. The open-concept living space maximizes natural light & panoramic views, creating an indoor-outdoor flow that feels intentional, calm, & easy to live in. This property offers a new high-functioning A/C system (2026) & one valet parking spot. At Brickell Heights, your day may begin with a workout in the fitness center or a quiet moment at the spa, followed by time spent poolside at the rooftop sky pool, where views stretch endlessly across the city. Evenings can unfold in the private screening room, one of the clubrooms & valet services are there to simplify the details, so daily life feels streamlined rather than scheduled. Just outside your front door, Brickell's best moments feel close & intuitive. Saks, Casa Tua Cucina, Equinox, CMX Cinema & Sugar at EAST Hotel are all within easy reach, turning dining, shopping, & entertainment into spontaneous choices rather than planned outings. Suite 4004 is a home for those who value perspective, light and ease-a place that supports the flow of city living while offering space to pause above it.",

Out back is where the lifestyle truly unfolds. Designed as a private sanctuary, the backyard features a resort-style pool, a full outdoor kitchen, and thoughtfully planned green spaces that invite a connection to nature. A charming cottage is nestled among the greenery, creating a setting that feels peaceful, intentional, and deeply grounding. Inside, light-filled living spaces flow seamlessly through the living room, formal dining area, and chef's kitchen. The kitchen is accompanied by a gas Wolf range, Sub-Zero refrigerator, and electric double wall ovens. Extensive custom millwork throughout the kitchen, family room, and library adds craftsmanship and architectural character. A dedicated wine room enhances the home's refined yet relaxed lifestyle. Custom lighting and chandeliers elevate each space. A three-car garage-with one bay converted into a home gym offers flexibility for modern living. Impact windows and a whole-home generator provide comfort and peace of mind. This home offers a coveted suburban lifestyle with walkability-just minutes to restaurants, parks, water access, and everyday conveniences.

This brand new construction by renowned architect Luigi Vitalini reflects refined craftsmanship, intentional design, and a seamless connection to the surrounding natural landscape. Interiors feature custom American walnut cabinetry, Kohler fixtures, JennAir appliances, and a combination of large format porcelain tile and solid oak wood flooring. The expansive great room opens effortlessly to a screened patio, creating a natural indoor outdoor flow where you are safe from the mosquitoes. A hard wired Aural stereo system, controlled by smart devices, enhances both everyday living and entertaining. The property is situated on the very top of the highest natural ground in Coconut Grove, called the Miami Rock Ridge, a limestone formation with elevations generally ranging from approximately 10 to over 20 feet above sea level. This elevated and stable terrain offers a notable advantage compared to surrounding lower lying coastal areas. The home's design thoughtfully responds to the site's elevation, with a lower level foyer that reflects the architect's intentional approach to the land. Property sits on an impressive 8,750 sq ft lot with a garage. This property has a huge garden for all to enjoy, roam, and explore safely behind a 6' fence. The pool comes with a safety net anchored into the coping, instead of the standard pool fence.",

Combined, the lots total 21, 580 ft of land with the potential by right to build twenty-three units. The owners' vision is that of a loosely tied Townhome Enclave . All the parcels are positioned centrally within the Little River vicinity, nestled just northwest of the prosperous Edgewater and NIMO neighborhoods. To the south lie Downtown Miami and Miami Beach, while to the north, North Miami Beach remains a focal point for developers. As of 2024, it comprises 9% of Miami's units under construction, marking a significant surge from slightly over 4% prior to 2019. Sales volume accelerated in 2021 but has since slowed, with $110 million in volume in 2022 and 2023 volume totaling $170 million, still, this remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.",
